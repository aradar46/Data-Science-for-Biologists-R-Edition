# Data Science for Biologists — R Edition

> A complete, R-native adaptation of the *Data Science in Python* course originally developed by the **Data Science Academy at AstraZeneca**. Every lecture, solution, and student challenge has been rewritten from the ground up using **R**, **tidyverse**, and **tidymodels** — no Python required.

---

## Background & Motivation

The original course — *Data Science in Python* — was a 7-week training programme run by the Data Science Academy, AstraZeneca (Cambridge, UK), covering data handling, visualisation, statistics, and machine learning through Python/pandas/scikit-learn. It was delivered multiple times between 2020 and 2022 and used a real-world breast cancer dataset (METABRIC) as the running example.

Many biologists and life scientists work primarily in R, using it for bioinformatics, statistics, and reproducible research. This repository is a **full R conversion** of that curriculum, providing the same conceptual coverage and pedagogical structure, but expressed entirely in idiomatic R:

| Original (Python) | R Equivalent |
|---|---|
| `pandas` DataFrame | `tibble` / `tidyverse` |
| `matplotlib` / `seaborn` | `ggplot2` |
| `scikit-learn` | `tidymodels` |
| Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) | R Markdown (`.Rmd`) |
| `numpy` arrays | R vectors / matrices |
| `statsmodels` | `stats` / `broom` |
| `networkx` | `tidygraph` / `ggraph` |

### Supplementary ggplot2 Notebooks (Week 2 Extra)

A series of focused notebooks covering advanced `ggplot2` topics:
line plots, scatter plots, error bars, density plots, histograms, legends, colourbars, multi-panel layouts, text annotation, tick customisation, themes, 3D plotting, geographic data, advanced statistical visualisation, and further resources.

## Primary Dataset — METABRIC

The **Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC)** dataset is used as the running example throughout the course. It contains clinical variables and gene expression data for ~1,900 breast cancer patients.

> Source: [Pereira et al., *Nature Communications*, 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11479)

The dataset is located at `data/metabric_clinical_and_expression_data.csv`.

### Install Required Packages

Open RStudio and run the following once:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse", "tidymodels", "broom", "ggpubr", "GGally",
  "ranger", "vip", "rpart", "palmerpenguins",
  "tidygraph", "ggraph", "visNetwork",
  "survival", "survminer", "factoextra",
  "AER", "corrplot", "cluster", "writexl",
  "maps", "scales"
))
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/data-science-for-biologists-AZ.git
cd data-science-for-biologists-AZ
```

### Open and Run a Notebook

1. Open RStudio
2. Navigate to `notebooks_R/`
3. Open any `.Rmd` file (e.g., `week1_lecture.Rmd`)
4. Click **Knit** to render it to HTML, or run chunks interactively

### Render All Notebooks at Once

```r
source("render_all.R")
```

## Student Challenges

The `challenge_R/` folder contains real student project submissions that were adapted to R. These demonstrate how to apply course concepts to custom datasets:

- **KatarzynaNurzynska** — METABRIC survival and subtype analysis (`week8_Metabric_data_analysis.Rmd`)
- **RobertShaw** — Particle size data processing and reporting (`G3_example_DEMO.Rmd`)
